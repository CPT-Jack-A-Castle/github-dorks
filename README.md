# GitHub security best practices

- Always check/review your code: this will help you identify any employee's bad security practices. 
- Clear your GitHub history to protect your most sensitive information. 
- Use ENV variables to store key information in CI/CD. Tools such as Vault are one of the best suggestions for these situations. 
- If you are sure that the data has been exposed, make sure to invalidate the token and password. 
- Configure 2FA for all your GitHub accounts
- Once employees no longer work for your company, be sure to revoke all their access rights.
- Write and publish a disclosure policy in your SECURITY.md file. Never let your company’s developers share GitHub credentials with anyone.
